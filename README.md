Seemingly stuck and longtime-unconfirmed transactions can be quite annoying for Bitcoin users.

Memo (mempool.observer) periodically takes a snapshot of a nodes memory pool. Recent data is then visualized and users can lookup the position of their transaction. The idea is to inform about the memory pool and to provide tool to double-check estimated fee/size-ratios.
