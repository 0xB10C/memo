# memo - mempool.observer

<img align="right" width="280" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xB10C/memo/v2-master/www/img/brand-icon.png">

[mempool.observer](https://mempool.observer) visualizes various statistics around my Bitcoin memory pool (mempool).
Seemingly stuck and longtime-unconfirmed transactions can be quite annoying for users transacting on the Bitcoin network.
The idea of mempool.observer is to provide users with information about unconfirmed transactions and transaction fees.

## Project History

I've started building the first version of mempool.observer mid 2017 as my first Bitcoin related project.
I was (and still am) motivated by presumably Greg Maxwell's words:

>"What's going to happen to Bitcoin?" is the wrong question. The right question is "What are you going to contribute?" &mdash; <cite>[Greg Maxwell](https://github.com/gmaxwell)</cite>

Later this year the bitcoin transaction fees rose and I had quite some traffic.
The high fees were caused by a huge transaction flood as the price rose to $20k.
I regularly had problems with long running scripts due to querying and processing the huge mempool on a low end VPS.
Due to time constrains I wasn't able to improve the performance.
This resulted in mempool.observer v1 dieing the not-maintained-death sometime in 2018.

I've focused full time on Bitcoin in spring 2019 and spend a part of that time to work on v2.
V2 is a full rewrite of mempool.observer - only the idea, license and the quote from Maxwell remained.
The goal is to offer way more than v1 did, but build on a foundation with performance and maintainability in mind.
I'm open for ideas and feedback.
